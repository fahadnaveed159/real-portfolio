        Hi, I'm Fahad â€” a frontend developer based in Pakistan, passionate about
        creating fast, clean, and user-friendly web experiences. My journey into
        web development started with a deep curiosity about how websites work.
        Over time, that curiosity turned into a strong passion for crafting
        beautiful, functional interfaces that not only look good but perform
        smoothly across all devices. I specialize in modern frontend
        technologies like HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Vue.js, and Tailwind CSS. I
        recently worked on a cinema-based movie streaming website, where I
        focused on building a responsive UI, smooth navigation, and an engaging
        user experience. That project helped me understand the importance of
        performance, code structure, and real-world problem-solving..
