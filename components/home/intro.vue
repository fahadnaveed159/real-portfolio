          Hi, I'm Fahad â€” a frontend developer based in Pakistan, passionate about
          creating fast, clean, and user-friendly web experiences. My journey into
          web development started with a deep curiosity about how websites work.
          Over time, that curiosity turned into a strong passion for crafting
          beautiful, functional interfaces that not only look good but perform
          smoothly across all devices. I specialize in modern frontend
          technologies like HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Vue.js, and Tailwind CSS. I
          recently worked on a cinema-based movie streaming website, where I
          focused on building a responsive UI, smooth navigation, and an engaging
          user experience. That project helped me understand the importance of
          performance, code structure, and real-world problem-solving..
