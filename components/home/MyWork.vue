        This project is a cinema-focused movie streaming website that I built to
        enhance my frontend development skills and explore the real-world
        challenges of UI/UX design, responsiveness, and performance
        optimization. The platform allows users to browse movies, view details,
        and stream content in a clean, intuitive layout. I used Vue.js for
        building dynamic components and Tailwind CSS for responsive styling,
        which helped in creating a modern and consistent design across all
        devices.
